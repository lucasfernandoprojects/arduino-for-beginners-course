# Arduino for Beginners: Full Course Repository 🎓⚡

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Arduino for Beginners** YouTube course! This is a **24-lesson video series** designed to teach you how to use Arduino from scratch — even if you've never touched electronics or written a single line of code before.

## 🚀 Course Overview

This course was built to help **beginners** learn how to create amazing real-world projects using Arduino. You'll learn:

- How Arduino works (hardware + software)
- How to use sensors, displays, motors, and modules
- How to write code with the Arduino IDE and Mind+
- How to build smart devices like home automation, alarms, web servers, and more!

> 💡 All lessons are **hands-on**, and each one includes **project files, code, and schematics** in this repository.
