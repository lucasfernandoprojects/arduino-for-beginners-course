## 🚀 Course Overview

This course was built to help **beginners** learn how to create amazing real-world projects using Arduino. You'll learn:

- How Arduino works (hardware + software)
- How to use sensors, displays, motors, and modules
- How to write code with the Arduino IDE and Mind+
- How to build smart devices like home automation, alarms, web servers, and more!

> 💡 All lessons are **hands-on**, and each one includes **project files, code, and schematics** in this repository.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into **5 folders**, that represent the modules. Each one contains one directory for each lesson:
```bash
arduino-for-beginners/
├── 📁module-1
    ├── 📁lesson-1-why-learn-arduino/
    ├── 📁lesson-2-story-of-arduino/
    ├── 📁lesson-3-arduino-ide-and-mind-plus/
├── ...
├── 📁module-5
    ├── 📁lesson-24-continuing-your-arduino-journey/
```

Each folder typically contains:

| File/Folder              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `code.ino`               | Arduino sketch file used in the lesson |
| `circuit_diagram.png`    | Wiring diagram for the project (from Fritzing or equivalent) |
| `README.md`              | Notes, objectives, and components used |
